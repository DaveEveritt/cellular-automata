# Experiments with cellular automata

Right now, these examples are taken straight from the inspirational JavaScript library [Terra](http://rileyjshaw.com/terra/) ([Terra on GitHub](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/terra)), created by [Riley J Shaw](http://rileyjshaw.com), who is also [a fan](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/nature-of-code/ "I do like following the rabbit-holes of influence") of Daniel Shiffman's book (see [Processing](https://processing.org)) [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/).

Comment/uncomment each of the script tags (one at a time) in the HTML file to run each example.

So far, the only change I've made to the examples is to achieve a longer-lasting temporary equilibrium in the Brute-Bully code (and alter colours) - renamed 'ice' and 'fire' becasue that's what it looks like.
